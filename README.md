## Meaningless Email App

This app has a kind of silly email version.  
Create messages from "Andy Novocin" with variable titles.
Click a subject line to see the message.
Click "X" to archive it.

The functionality of the App is not the point.

This app demonstrates a decoupled, event-driven MVC paradigm using BackboneJS.

Event driven coding is highly decoupled when done correctly (sometimes it is too decoupled).

In general everything is callback functions and data.
